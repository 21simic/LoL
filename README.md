League of Legends client
I recreated league of legends client using html css & javascript for exercise. Its not responsive of course but it looks pretty similar.
I know i could've added 'select' instead of 'button' for choosing regions but i totally forgot about 'select' tag xD.
Also for some reason create new account and can't sign up padding is bugged and when you hover pretty far from it on the right side it still highlights it.
